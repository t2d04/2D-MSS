# 2D-MSS (2D Maximum Subsequence Sum)

This code was submitted as an assignment for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (CSE3081) course in the Fall 2024 semester at Sogang University.


It provides three solutions to the 2D Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem using the Summed Area Table, Divide and Conquer, and a modified version of Kadane's algorithm.
This code also calculates and displays CPU usage time, illustrating the impact of time complexity for each algorithm.
